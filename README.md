This project was started in the winter of 2021 and was semi-completed in 2022. 

The goal of this project was to create an online gallery where NFT owners could share and show off their expensive NFTs with friends and others. This was my first attempt at designing an online application for IOS, Android, and as a Chrome Web app. 

What inspired this project was me foolishly spending a lot of money on NFTs and wanting a way to show them off to others. 

This project was a great introduction into the world of programming, front end user design, and project management. The app may have not been completed, but it served its purpose in teaching me the technical resilience and confidence needed to create an application from scratch.

I hope the skills I learned during this project will be applied to many more in the future.
